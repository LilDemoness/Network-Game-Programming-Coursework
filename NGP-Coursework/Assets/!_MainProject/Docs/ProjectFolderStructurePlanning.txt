Project Folder Structure Planning
---------------------------------

Folder Structure (Root Folder is 'Assets'):
> !_MainProject
	> Audio - Stores all Audio Files
		> Music
		> SoundEffects
	> Animations - Stores all animations for the project, organised into subfolders by type/model/etc
	> Art
		> Materials
		> Models
		> Sprites
		> Textures
	> Code
		> Scripts
			> Characters
			> Editor		
			> GameState
			> Networking
			> Player
			> Utils
		> Shaders
	> Docs
	> Level
		> Prefabs
		> Scenes
	> Resources
		> Fonts
		> Input
	> Settings - Stores settings for things like Build Profiles, Network Prefabs, etc
> [Other Asset Packs (E.g. TextMesh Pro, UI Toolkit, etc]



Other Notes:
- Keep All materials, textures, meshes, etc within their folders, not stored together. We can still have sub-folders of the folders under 'Art'
	(E.g. Art>Models>Player>... & Art>Materials>Player>..., not Art>Models>Player>... & Art>Models>Player>Materials>...)
